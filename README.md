Codility Style Test Runner

I wanted to play around with DSA on my own machine. I went down a tangent and voila, a test runner is born. 

**Inputs**

test-input.txt -put your test inputs here, each line is a new argument
Currently it is set up to read an int array, followed by two ints, to change this you will need to edit program.cs
Might make a class for this later for better flexibility

**Outputs**

Outputs to console on first line

**Tests**

Drop you solution as Solution.cs into main folder, class and method should be 'Solution' and 'solution' respectively

**To Run**

Once you have a valid Solution.cs and test-input.txt, build and run in visual studio. Enjoy!
